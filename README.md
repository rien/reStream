reMarkable screen sharing over SSH.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rien/reStream`.
2. (Optional but recommended) [Install lz4 on your host and reMarkable](#sub-second-latency).
3. [Set up an SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), then add your key to the reMarkable with `ssh-copy-id root@10.11.99.1`.
4. (Optional) If you want to connect using wifi (as fallback to usb) change `ssh_host_wifi` in `reStream.sh` (e.g. `root@192.168.178.16`)

## Usage

1. Connect your reMarkable with the USB cable.
2. Make sure you can [open an SSH connection](https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh).
3. Run `./reStream.sh` for landscape mode, or `./reStram.sh -p` for portrait mode.
4. A screen will pop-up on your local machine, with a live view of your reMarkable!

## Requirements

On your **host** machine:
- Any POSIX-shell (e.g. bash)
- ffmpeg (with ffplay)
- ssh

On your **reMarkable** nothing is needed, unless you want...

### Sub-second latency

To achieve sub-second latency, you'll need [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4)
on your host and on your reMarkable.

You can install `lz4` on your host with your usual package manager. On Ubuntu,
`apt install liblz4-tool` will do the trick.

On your **reMarkable** you'll need a binary of `lz4` build for the arm platform,
you can do this yourself by [installing the reMarkable toolchain](https://remarkablewiki.com/devel/qt_creator#toolchain)
and compiling `lz4` from source with the toolchain enabled, or you can use the
statically linked binary I have already built and put in this repo.

Copy the `lz4` program to your reMarkable with
`scp lz4.arm.static root@10.11.99.1:~/lz4`, make it executable with
`ssh root@10.11.99.1 'chmod +x ~/lz4'` and you're ready to go.

## Troubleshooting

Steps you can try if the script isn't working:
- [Set up an SSH key](#installation)
- Update `ffmpeg` to version 4.
